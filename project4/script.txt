Hi Hi Hi
I am opheliagame
and this is my virtual studio

Have we met before?

Maybe you already know that 
I make generative things 
and think about 
color
movement 
lines
type

I write code
and poems 
and websites  

I l(a)ive code visuals
sometimes alone 
sometimes with shaders
a lot of times with other live coders

I think 
about software 
about language
about archives
about storytelling 

But most importantly I have fun doing all these things and if it wasn't for experimenting and failing and being wrong but not being afraid of being wrong in public, I would not be doing any of these things. These things excite me, scare me, bring me joy and give me meaning. The most wonderful people I have and continue to meet inspire me and keep me going, even on the days when I think none of it has any meaning. They remind me that life is short and we are just a blip; but this blip is all we have and that's why it matters. That's why it matters how we blip; and how we blop.
